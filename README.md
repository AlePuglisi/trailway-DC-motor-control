This repository contains the code (MATLAB scripts and Simulink model) and report of the final assignment of a course on [Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=837862&__pj0=0&__pj1=52cb81e9c76fcd372f5858307a2f494a).

In this project, I developed **MATLAB** and **Simulink** software to simulate and control the **DC Separately Excited Motor** used in the original "Carrelli 1928" Tram of Milan. 

## Objective 
Given the datasheet of the motor under analysis, and additional data on the load and the railway track: 
- Find the Motor Design parameters
- Tune and Simulate speed/current control (motor driver), showing its reliability on the defined track.

Rely on classical **Bode** theory to analyze control performances, and prove it in simulation.
